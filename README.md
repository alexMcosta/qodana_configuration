# Qodana Configuration Examples

## Summary
I highly recommend if you randomly stumbled here than you should read this whole README. This will be the centralized document for all configuration files in here.

## Security only
There may be a time when you want to have a separate configuration for security folks then for software engineers. If this is the case then [security-only.yaml](https://github.com/alexMcosta/qodana_configuration/blob/main/security-only.yaml) will be the route you want to go. It is configured for all security inspections for every linter/language to make it universal. Only thing it does not include is Taint Analysis since at this time its only available for Java and PHP and only on Jetbrains IDEâ€™s
When using this I recommend having it run as a monorepo setting up two scans. One for your regular scan and one for Security. If you happen to be adding this to a [monorep](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/monorepo-project.html) then just configure it as a third scan.
